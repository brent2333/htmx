<P>ðŸ‘‹ <br/>Welcome to my "portfolio site". I knew it was time to work on some self-promo after several years of doing little aside from posting learnings in LinkedIn. I reazlied one day that this could also be an opportunity to express myself; to tallk about my perspective as a primarily Front-End developer with over a decade of industry experience. I'm not really as crabby as I may seem in my small rant there, promise ;)</P>
<p>I have worked as an individual contributor, team lead and a manager. It feels to me that I have worn many hats since jumping head-first into the wild, weird and <i>sometimes</i> wonderful world of web development.</p>
<p>Performant, accessible and manageable front-ends is what I would like to create.</p>
